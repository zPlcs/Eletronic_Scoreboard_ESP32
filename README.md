# Eletronic_Scoreboard_ESP32

 An electronic scoreboard controlled by a cell phone from a web page.

# How it Works

The project works as follows, there are 2 (two) ESPs32, 1 (one) of which is the Server, which creates the WiFi network, which will be possible to connect on the cell phone, and the other esp works as a client, which connects to the ESP Server, and passes information over an HTTP connection.
